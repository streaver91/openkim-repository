This MODEL DRIVER implementation of the EDIP bond-order model computes energy, forces, and virial using the CLUSTER, NEIGH_PURE_F, or MI_OPBC_F NBC methods.

This version supports flexible unit handling and model parameter publishing (all parameters are 'free' to be changed by the test).

NOTE: I've eliminated the 'delta' parameter that was in the original version of this model (for Silicon this has a value of delta = 78.7590539) and, instead, directly used 'eta' as a free parameter.
'delta' and 'eta' are related through eta = delta/Q0 (Q0 is another free parameter), but because the latest EDIP publication lists a value for eta rather than delta, it seemed more appropriate to use
'eta' as a free parameter in its own right and forget about delta.  For Silicon, eta = 0.2523244 is the value cited in the EDIP papers.

Note: Since forces are required to compute the virial, the forces will be computed even if the Test asks only for the virial.

-----------------------------------------
A note on how this model is implemented:

I adapted this model from Prof. Martin Z. Bazant's (bazant@math.mit.edu) code (thanks also to Prof. Joao F. Justo for an additional FORTRAN reference code).
Because of the coordination-dependency of the 2-body and 3-body terms, we're forced to do multiple loops over all of the atoms.
The first inner loop (the "Pre-pass loop") goes over all of the other atoms and determines which ones are inside the cutoff radius of the atom being considered by the outer loop.
For those within the cutoff radius, it computes part of the 2-body interaction (the part that doesn't require the coordination to be known)
and the radial parts of the 3-body interaction.  Finally, the coordination of each of the atoms within the cutoff
is added onto the total coordination, Z, for that atom.  Having Z, we now have to loop over all other atoms once more
in order to calculate the coordination-dependent portion of the 2-body energy and get the final 2-body energy for the atom
being considered in the outermost loop, V2.  Note also that we are unable to perform a "half-summation" for the two-body terms
(with an outer loop over i and an inner loop over j>i) because of the asymmetry the coordination introduces into the 2-body energy (V2(R_ij,Z_i) != V2(R_ji,Z_j)).
We also need to use Z to perform another set of nested loops in order to calculate the coordination-dependent portion of the
3-body energy, h(l,Z).  This will give us the total 3-body energy for the atom being considered in the outermost loop, V3.
Since we are forced to loop over the same atoms multiple times (first to get the coordination and then to compute the energies),
it makes sense to reduce the computational expense of the subsequent looping by only looping over the atoms which have already been
determined to fall within the cutoff radius.  To this end, this code generates its own *internal* neighbor list even if it is not provided
by the test i.e. the test only supports the CLUSTER NBC mode.

If you are interested in an explanation of the looping structure, etc., in this code and why it was chosen, I highly recommend looking at chapter 6 of Prof. Bazant's 1997 Ph.D. thesis, available at http://web.mit.edu/bazant/www/thesis/md.html.
Page 156 of this thesis includes a pseudocode of what has been implemented here.
