{"description" "Effective Medium Theory (EMT) model driver based on the EMT implementation in\nASAP (https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/asap).\n\nEffective Medium Theory is a many-body potential of the same class as Embedded\nAtom Method, Finnis-Sinclair etc.  The main term in the energy per atom is the\nlocal density of atoms.\n\nThe functional form implemented here is that of Ref. 1.  The principles behind\nEMT are described in Refs. 2 and 3 (with 2 being the more detailed and 3 being\nthe most pedagogical).  Be aware that the functional form and even some of the\nprinciples have changed since refs 2 and 3.  EMT can be considered the last\nstep of a series of approximations starting with Density Functional Theory,\nsee Ref 4.\n\nThese files are based on Asap version 3.8.1 (SVN revision 1738).\n\n\nREFERENCES:\n\n[1] Jacobsen, K.

It should be\n  implemented.\n\n* More testing is needed."
