This directory (Pair_Lennard_Jones_Shifted) contains a shifted Lennard-Jones
pair potential model driver written in Fortran 90.

   phi(r) = 4 * epsilon * ( (sigma/r)^12 - (sigma/r)^6 ) + shift

where 'shift' is computed so that phi(rcut) = 0.0, and 'rcut' is the 
cutoff radius.

It complies with the KIM API interface standard, using any NBC and iterator 
or locator mode, publishes its parameters, and supports optional computation 
of `energy', `forces', `particleEnergy', `process_dEdr', and `process_dE2dr2'.
Its initialization routine takes a KIM API object pointer, a pointer to a
two-dimensional character array (each row of which contains the full path to 
a parameter file) of the form a[b][c], a pointer to the value of c, and a pointer to the value of b.  This Model Driver expects that only b=1 and that 
the associated parameter file contains the cutoff and Lennard-Jones parameters
which define a KIM Model based on this KIM Model Driver.

To create a KIM Model from this Model Driver, a parameter file is required.
This file must have the following format:

   Line 1: `cutoff' value in angstroms
   Line 2: Lennard-Jones `epsilon' value in eV
   Line 3: Lennard-Jones `sigma' value in Angstroms

The following files are in this directory (before any compilation is performed):

    This file

Pair_Lennard_Jones_Shifted.F90
    Fortran 90 file that contains the implementation of the Lennard-Jones
    potential Model Driver

Pair_Lennard_Jones_Shifted.kim.tpl
    Template KIM descriptor file containing all variables and methods that are
    exposed by the driver through the KIM API interface.  This file will be
    used (by the make system) to generate a KIM descriptor file for each KIM
    Model based on this Model Driver.
