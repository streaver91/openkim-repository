This directory (Three_Body_Stillinger_Weber__MD_335816936951_001) contains Stillinger-Weber potential
Model driver written in C.


/*******************************************************************************

* For three-body potential any potential energy function for N-particle system can be written in the
* following form of two-body and three-body terms:
     F(1, 2, ...., N)   = sum_{i; 1 <= i < j <= N} phi_two(r; r = r_ij)
                          + sum_{i; 1 <= i \neq j < k <= N} phi_three(r_ij, r_ik, r_jk);

* For Stillinger-Weber, two-body term phi_two is

     phi_two(r) = epsilon * f_2(r_cap; r_cap = r/sigma); where f_2 is

     f_2(r_cap) = A * ( B*r_cap^(-p) - r_cap^-q ) * exp(1/(r_cap - a)); when  r_cap <  a
                = 0   when r_cap >= a

* and three-body term phi_three is

     phi_three(r_ij, r_ik, r_jk) = epsilon * f_3(r1_cap, r2_cap, r3_cap); where

     r1_cap = r_ij/sigma, r2_cap = r_ik/sigma, r3_cap = r_jk/sigma,      and

     f_3(r1_cap, r2_cap, r3_cap) = lambda * (exp(gamma((1/(r1_cap - a)) + (1/(r2_cap - a))))) * (costheta_jik - costheta_0)^2;  when r1_cap < a && r2_cap < a
                                 = 0;                                                                                           otherwise

     costheta_jik = (r_ij^2 + r_ik^2 - r_jk^2) / (2*r_ij*r_ik).

It complies with the KIM API interface standard, using two neihgbor handling methods,
NEIGH_PURE_F and NEIGH_RVEC_F and iterator or locator mode. It publishes its parameters
and supports optional computation of `energy', 'forces', 'particleEnergy', 'process_dEdr',
and 'process_dE2dr2'. Its initializaton routine takes a KIM API object pointer and
a pointer to a string that contains all parameters which define a KIM Model
based on this KIM Model Driver.


To create a KIM Model from this Model Driver, a parameter file is required.
This file must have the follwing format:
   Line 1: A
   Line 2: B
   Line 3: p
   Line 4: q
   Line 5: a
   Line 6: lambda
   Line 7: gamma
   Line 8: sigma in Angstrom
   Line 9: epsilon in ev
   Line 10: costheta_0
Any additional lines will be silently ignored.
