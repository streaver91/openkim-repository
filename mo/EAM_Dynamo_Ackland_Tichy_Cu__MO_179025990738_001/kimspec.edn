(1990)\n  Excellent description of alloys with iron\n\"Computer simulation of Point Defect Properties in dilute Fe-Cu alloy using a many-body interatomic potential\" G.J.Ackland, D.J.Bacon, A.F.Calder and T.Harry Phil.Mag.A, 75 713-732 (1997) \nFor initial impact in cascade simulations, a harder core pair potential  in Biersack-Zigler form is added.\nDoes not give the 9R structure for Cu precipitates in Fe, rather almost randomly stacked close packed planes.  However, this is completely consistent with the experimental data, which does not prove 9R.\n\" Phase Transitions of Copper Precipitates in Fe-Cu Alloys\" J.J.Blackstock and G.J.Ackland, Phil.Mag.A, 81, 2127-48 (2001)"
