{"description" "EAM type potential, fitted to elasticity.  Gives good plastic behaviour, and fitted with cross potentials for the Ni-Al system, describing the strong bonding and Ni3Al NiAl phases.  Strong ordering tendency: contrast with CuAu for disordering energy.   For radiation damage, add a Biersack-Ziegler function in the pairwise part."
 "disclaimer" "no tratment of antiferromarnetism, although this doesn't seem to affect performance."
