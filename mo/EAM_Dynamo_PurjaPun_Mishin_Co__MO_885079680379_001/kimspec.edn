{"description" "It is an EAM potential that accurately represents low temerature (hcp) and high temperature (fcc) phases of Cobalt. It is intended to develop EAM potentials for alloys of Cobalt."
 "disclaimer" "The potential accurately represents most of the properties of the hcp and the fcc phases of Co including the phase transition temperature."
