Effective Medium Theory (EMT) model based on the EMT implementation in
ASAP (https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/asap).  This model uses the asap_emt_driver
model driver.

Effective Medium Theory is a many-body potential of the same class as Embedded
Atom Method, Finnis-Sinclair etc.  The main term in the energy per atom is the
local density of atoms.

The functional form implemented here is that of Ref. 1.  The principles behind
EMT are described in Refs. 2 and 3 (with 2 being the more detailed and 3 being
the most pedagogical).  Be aware that the functional form and even some of the
principles have changed since refs 2 and 3.  EMT can be considered the last
step of a series of approximations starting with Density Functional Theory,
see Ref 4.

This model implements the "official" parametrization as published in Ref. 1.

These files are based on Asap version 3.8.1 (SVN revision 1738).

CHANGES:

Changes in 002:

* Bug fix: version 001 would crash with most tests/simulators due to an internal
  consistency test failing.
  
* Bug fix: version 001 reported a slightly too short cutoff, leading to small
  inaccuracies (probably only for Au).
  
* Bug fix: Memory leaks removed.
  
* Enhancement: version 002 now supports ghost atoms (parallel simulations, many
  other tests).
  
* Enhancement: version 002 now supports all neighbor list types, although the 
  half lists give the best performance.


KNOWN ISSUES / BUGS:

* On-the-fly modifications of the parameters is not supported.  It should be
  implemented.

* More testing is needed.
