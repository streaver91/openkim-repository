{"description" "This is a glue potential (which has the same functional form as EAM) for pure aluminum due to F. Ercolessi and J. B. Adams.  The potential was developed using the \"force-matching method\", which includes forces from first-principles calculations in the fitting data base.  The potential was fitted to properties of face-centered cubic (fcc) crystals."
 "disclaimer" "By design, this potential is not expected to be accurate for geometries with extremely low coordination -- such as small molecules -- which were not included in the input set."
