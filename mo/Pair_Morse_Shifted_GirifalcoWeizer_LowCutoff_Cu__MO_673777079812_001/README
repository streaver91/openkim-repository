This directory (Pair_Morse_Shifted_GirifalcoWeizer_LowCutoff_Cu__MO_673777079812_001)
contains a shifted Morse pair potential Model based on the KIM Model Driver
Pair_Morse_Shifted.  This Model implements the Morse potential for Cu created
by Girifalco and Weizer (see Cu.params for the reference).  In the original
paper no cutoff distance was used.  Here we have choosen a cutoff so that the
pair energy at the cutoff is given by (1.0e-02)*|epsilon|.


The following files are in this directory (before any compilation is performed):

LICENSE.CDDL

Makefile
    makefile to compile and build the Model based on the specified KIM Model
    Driver
