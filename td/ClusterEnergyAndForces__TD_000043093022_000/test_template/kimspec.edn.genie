  "description" "Computes the potential energy and forces of a random cluster of {{symbol}} atoms and performs
a conjugate gradient relaxation of the positions.  The positions of the atoms in this Test were
obtained by first randomly initializing a set of {{symbol}} atoms in a cubic box of side length
{{sidelength}} Angstroms (fixed, reflective boundary conditions).  Dynamics were then performed
in LAMMPS (http://lammps.sandia.gov) under a Tersoff (T2) potential by heating the system to ~4100K
under a Langevin thermostat for {{numtimesteps}} timesteps (each timestep = 0.001ps). Finally, the
atomic positions were extracted and are used as the initial positions for the relaxation."
