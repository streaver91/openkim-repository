This Test Driver uses LAMMPS to compute the energy and forces acting on an arbitrary monoatomic cluster of atoms.  It then relaxes the cluster using conjugate gradient energy minimization.

Note: Although the Tests constructed from this Test Driver can be assembled using `testgenie`, the actual xyz data files for each of the Tests are contained in xyz_input_files.tgz.
