This Test uses the {{TEST_DRIVER}} Test Driver to compute the cohesive energy of a {{lattice}} lattice of {{fullsymbol}} atoms
at a variety of lattice spacings ranging from {{aminfrac}}*a_0 to {{amaxfrac}}*a_0.
The value of "a_0" (as it is referred to in the Test Driver) passed to the Test Driver is taken to be
the equilibrium lattice constant for the Model being used, as obtained by querying the KIM database for
Test Results from the LatticeConstantCubicEnergy_{{lattice}}_{{symbol}} Test when paired against the relevant Model.
