  "description" "This Test computes an energy vs. lattice constant curve for {{lattice}} {{fullsymbol}}.  The
curve is computed for lattice constants ranging from {{aminfrac}}*a_0 to {{amaxfrac}}*a_0,
where a_0 represents the equilibrium lattice constant.  The value for a_0 is obtained by querying
the KIM database for the results of LatticeConstantCubicEnergy_{{lattice}}_{{symbol}} when paired
against the Model being used."
