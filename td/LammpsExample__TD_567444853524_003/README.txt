This example Test Driver illustrates the use of LAMMPS in the openkim-pipeline to compute the equilibrium lattice spacing and cohesive energy of fcc Argon using
Polak-Ribiere conjugate gradient minimization in LAMMPS and an initial guess at the equilibrium lattice spacing supplied by the user through pipeline.stdin.tpl.
