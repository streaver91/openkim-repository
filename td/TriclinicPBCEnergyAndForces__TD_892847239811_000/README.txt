This Test Driver uses LAMMPS to compute the energy and forces acting on an arbitrary periodic, triclinic cell of monatomic atoms.

Note: Although the Tests constructed from this Test Driver can be assembled using `testgenie`, the actual xyz data files for each of the Tests are contained in xyz_input_files.tgz.
