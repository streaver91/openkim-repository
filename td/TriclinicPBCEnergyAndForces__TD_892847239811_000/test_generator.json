The box dimensions were then held fixed and dynamics were performed in LAMMPS (http://lammps.sandia.gov) under a Tersoff (T2) potential by heating the atoms to ~4100K using a Langevin thermostat for 2000 time steps (each time step was 0.001ps).  The system was then cooled to 0K using a Langevin thermostat for 15000 timesteps.  Finally, static minimization of the positions (using the conjugate gradient algorithm in LAMMPS) was performed under the T2 potential."}
